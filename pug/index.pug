          | Originating from Quebec,  
          strong poutine
          |  is a simple dish made with french fries, brown gravy and fresh cheese curds. Sometimes people add other things to their poutine, such as scallions or pork belly 
          |  or pickled onion or kimchi and 
          i that is totally fine.
          |   As long as the three basic ingredients are covered, it's poutine.
        p This website is an archive of things that self-describe as poutine, which, just so you know, aren't.
        p This website was done by
