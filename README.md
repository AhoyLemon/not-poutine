The purpose of this site is to catlog menu items which are descibed as poutine and yet are not poutine.

It's a simple SPA written in Pug and Vue. A single Vue object controls all the content delivered. Sorting, tagging and searching could eventually be added maybe, but that's only if there's enough entries and interest to warrant it.

If you'd like to add your own Poutine Crime, you can do so by using [this form](https://forms.gle/1zV1dYj7vh8t81wT9) or, if you feel like it, you could fork this repo and edit `js/partials/_variables.js` to include your entry. Images go into `img/crimes`.
